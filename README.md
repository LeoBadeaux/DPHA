# Welcome to DPHA (Desktop Prodigy Hacking Application)
# [Download (.exe - 64bit)](https://github.com/LeoBadeaux/DPHA/blob/main/out/make/squirrel.windows/x64/DPHA%20Setup.exe?raw=true)
This is an alternative injection method for the [PMGH/WCM Cheat Menu](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking).
You can also use the [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prodigy-hacking-extension/nmipcbdicnmjoifanpdcjdmifeioglkm) to inject WCM.
This application can co-exist as a standalone desktop app.

## What operating systems are supported?
In theory, DPHA should be supported on MacOS, Windows, Linux, and possibly ChromeOS.
However, due to time constraints, it is only supported on Windows at this time. Linux and ChromeOS support will likely come next.

## Notice
Please let me remind you this is bleeding-edge alpha code. If you experience a bug, please open an issue.
