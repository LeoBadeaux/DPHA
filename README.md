# Welcome to DPHA (Desktop Prodigy Hacking Application)
# [Download (.exe - 64bit)](https://github.com/LeoBadeaux/DPHA/blob/main/out/make/squirrel.windows/x64/DPHA%20Setup.exe?raw=true)
This is an alternative injection method for the [PMGH/WCM Cheat Menu](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking).
Currently, you use the chrome extension to inject WCM. However, due to upcoming changes enforced by chrome browsers beginning in 2023, the extension will no longer work.
This application can continue to work past that point as it injects the menu a bit differently.

## What operating systems are supported?
In theory, DPHA should be supported on MacOS, Windows, Linux, and possibly ChromeOS.
However, due to time constraints, it is only supported on Windows at this time. Linux and ChromeOS support will likely come next.

## Notice
Please let me remind you this is bleeding-edge alpha code. If you experience a bug, please open an issue.
